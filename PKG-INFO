        Features
        --------
        
        The ability to deploy a multi-node, role based OpenStack deployment using
        OpenStack Heat. Notable features include:
        
         * Choice of deployment/configuration tooling: puppet, (soon) docker
        
         * Role based deployment: roles for the controller, compute, ceph, swift,
           and cinder storage
        
         * physical network configuration: support for isolated networks, bonding,
           and standard ctlplane networking

         * environments: contains heat environment files that can be used with -e
                         on the command like to enable features, etc.
        
         * extraconfig: templates used to enable 'extra' functionality. Includes
                        functionality for distro specific registration and upgrades.
        
         * firstboot: example first_boot scripts that can be used when initially
                      creating instances.
        
         * network: heat templates to help create isolated networks and ports
        
         * puppet: templates mostly driven by configuration with puppet. To use these
                   templates you can use the overcloud-resource-registry-puppet.yaml.
        
         * validation-scripts: validation scripts useful to all deployment
                               configurations
