fixes:
  - Workaround systems getting registered as "localhost" during
    RHEL registration if they don't have a fqdn set by first
    rm'ing the /etc/rhsm/facts directory. When the directory does not
    exist, the katello-rshm-consumer which runs when installing
    the katello-ca-consumer will not set the hostname.override fact to
    "localhost". See https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1711435
